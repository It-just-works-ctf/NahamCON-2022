**Category** : Networking
**Points** : 500

<small>Author: @Kkevsterrr#7469</small><br><br>Our TCP flags have decided that they'd like to change places today; all you need to do is reach the HTTP server!<br> <br> Roses are red, and SYNs are FINs too.<br> RST+ACKs are now SYN+ACKs for you. <br> ACKs are now Es, and what else have we done? <br> PSH+ACKs are FIN+SYNs just for the fun. <br> <br> <br> <u><i>Hint: If you want to run this challenge from your home or a VM, make sure you are not behind a NAT that could eat your unexpected packets.</i></u> <br> <br> <pre>Interact with this challenge at: http://104.197.128.84</pre>
