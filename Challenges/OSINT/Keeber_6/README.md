<small>Author: @matlac#2291, @Gary#4657</small><br><br>After all of the damage the ex-employee's mistakes caused to the company, the Keeber Security Group is suing them for negligence! In order to file a proper lawsuit, we need to know where they are so someone can go and serve them. Can you find the ex-employee’s new workplace? The flag is in regular format, and can be found in a recent yelp review of their new workplace.<br> <br> (Hint: You will need to pivot off of the email found in the past challenge!)
