<small>Author: @Gary#4657</small><br><br>We've given you an intercepted ciphertext from our enemies. We also have access to their decryption validation oracle. The only other piece of information we know is that they are using something called PKCS#7 padding and the oracle will tell us whether the ciphertext we give them decrypts to a proper padding  by AES PKCS#7 standards. <br> <br> <b>Press the <code>Start</code> button on the top-right to begin this challenge.</b> <br> <br> <b>NOTE: The solution to this challenge takes a significant amount of time to run. You will likely need a multi-threaded solution.</b>
